/*
	FM. BISON hybrid FM synthesis
	(C) visualizers.nl & bipolaraudio.nl

	- Code is *very* verbose and has not been optimized yet (still in R&D stage)
	- Currently tooled to fit the JUCE 5.x framework
	- Synthesizer is stereo output only
	- Parameters are often filtered a bit, this is to alleviate crackle when for ex. coupled to a MIDI controller
	- 'SFM' is a legacy prefix & namespace name

	Third party credits (all of them public domain, please contact us if we're mistaken):
	- ADSR (modified), original by Nigel Redmon (earlevel.com)
	- SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.hpp (modified) by Fred Anton Corvest (https://github.com/FredAntonCorvest/Common-DSP)
	- MOOG-style ladder filter 'KrajeskiModel' (https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/blob/master/src/)
	- Reverb based on FreeVerb by Volker BÃ¶hm
	- TinyMT by Makoto Matsumoto and Mutsuo Saito 
	- Research (DX7 LFO LUT) from Sean Bolton's Hexter
	- Fast cosine approximation by (or at least supplied by) Erik Faye-Lund
	- A few good bits of JUCE are used (though this has little priority, as we rely on JUCE for our products) (*)
	- Vowel (formant) filter: contribution to http://www.musicdsp.org by alex@smartelectronix.com
	- A few other sources were used; these are credited in or close to the implementation

	(*) - Depends on JUCE 5.4.7 or compatible!

	The following files belong to the "Helper" part of the codebase:
		- synth-aligned-alloc.h
		- synth-fast-cosine.*
		- synth-fast-tan.h
		- synth-helper.h
		- synth-log.*
		- synth-math.h
		- synth-ring-buffer.h

	Unused components:
		- RingBuffer
		- Vowelizer
	
	Core goals:
		- Yamaha DX7 style core FM with extensions
		- Subtractive synthesis on top
		- Low footprint use in DAWs & possibly embedded targets later

	VST/JUCE related:
		- See PluginProcessor.cpp
		- *This* library is currently not thread-safe (it does not have to be)

	Reading material:
		- https://www.hackaudio.com/digital-signal-processing/amplitude/peak-normalization/
		- https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/DynamicSmoothing.pdf
		- Your freshly bought Will Pirkle book
 
	Issues:
		- Inlining strategy a bit too agressive?
		- Class (object) design is just sloppy in places as I started with pure C
		- For embedded use this needs review, a lot of choices were made in favor of the VST plug-in
		- Analyze and optimize performance! (17/01/2020)

	Not supported on purpose:
		- Polyphonic aftertouch (or just anything MPE!)

	
	For issues & tasks please see Github repository.
