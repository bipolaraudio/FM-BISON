	FM. BISON hybrid FM synthesis
	(C) visualizers.nl & bipolaraudio.nl

	- https://github.com/bipolaraudio/FM-BISON/issues
	- Code is quite verbose and has not been optimized "to the bone" yet (we're still in R&D stage)
	- Currently fitted to play nice with the JUCE framework, needs significant work to work with other platforms (especially embedded)
	- Synthesizer is stereo output *only*
	- Parameters are not just interpolated by also filtered to alleviate crackle during automation or MIDI control (see 'ParameterSlew')
	- 'SFM' is a legacy prefix & namespace name

	Third party credits (public domain, please contact us if we're mistaken):
	- ADSR & Biquad filter by Nigel Redmon (http://www.earlevel.com)
	- SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.hpp by Fred Anton Corvest (https://github.com/FredAntonCorvest/Common-DSP)
	- MOOG-style ladder filter: https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/MoogLadders/blob/master/src/
	- Reverb based on FreeVerb by Volker BÃ¶hm
	- TinyMT Mersenne-Twister random generator by Makoto Matsumoto and Mutsuo Saito 
	- Yamaha DX7 LFO rates (synth-DX7-LFO-table.h) taken from Sean Bolton's Hexter
	- Fast cosine approximation supplied by Erik 'Kusma' Faye-Lund
	- There are 2 dependencies on JUCE (currently these have little priority as we use JUCE for our product line)
	- 'PolyBLEP'-based oscillators were lifted from https://github.com/martinfinke/PolyBLEP; by various authors (I keep a copy in /3rdparty/PolyBLEP (ref.))
	- I've ported a lot of interpolation functions from http://easings.net to single prec.
	- *Big* thank you Adam Szabo for his thesis on the JP-8000 supersaw: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1852/250068e864215dd7f12755cf00636868a251.pdf 
	- A few bits and bytes left and right; these are all credited in or close to the implementation

	Most of these were modified and optimized by us

	** Depends on JUCE 6.01 or later! **
	
	Core goals:
		- Yamaha DX7 style core FM tone generator with a plethora of extra features
		- Subtractive synthesis (filters & effects) on top
		- Goal: low CPU footprint in DAWs, possibly embedded targets in the future

	This library is *not* thread-safe!
 
	Issues:
		- I've spotted some potentially overzealous and inconsistent use of SFM_INLINE (29/05/2020)
		- Class (object) design is somewhere between C and C++; this is because the project started out
		  as a simple (C) experiment; I've also started to use more modern C++ features here and there, but 
		  I'm not religious about it
		- Performance needs to be analyzed closer, especially on OSX

	Optimal compiler parameters for Visual Studio (MSVC):
		- /Ob2 /Oi /O2 /Ot
