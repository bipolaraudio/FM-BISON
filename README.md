# FM-BISON

FM.BISON 0.9 - A hybrid FM synthesis engine.

Our goal is to create fast & high quality synthesizer software.

What inspired FM. BISON is the 1980s digital revolution often based upon frequency modulation,
as discovered by accident by John Chowning in 1967. This type of synthesis yields a very distinct
sound that helped artists like Prince, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Brian Eno and many others
to define their new sound, mostly using the Yamaha DX7.

We stand on the shoulders of thousands of creative innovators, engineers, artists *and* the public
domain and we invite you to profit from the work we are doing to take FM to another level.

Our code is open to study, disassemble, improve and use in any way you like, so long as you adhere
to the MIT license.

Please refer to the Github issue list to keep track of our to-do list, to see what we're aware of and working 
on and the new features or improvements we have in mind.

This code is currently in use/development for our in-development Monk MKI plug-in (a 1980s-inspired virtual keyboard instrument). We'll announce when it's ready to hit the market.

Any significant contributions to this codebase will of course grant you a free copy!

Contact us if you're interested in any way or have questions: hello@bipolaraudio.nl

And if you use or benefit from our open development, we would love a shoutout on your socials, using #FM-BISON!
