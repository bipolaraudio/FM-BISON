# FM-BISON

FM. BISON - A hybrid FM synthesis engine.

# IMPORTANT ISSUES 

- Basic documentation will be written at some point; for now just explore our code, it has it's share of comments :)
- Github issue list is complete, please at least give it a once over since this project is under *heavy* development.
- Currently there are 2 dependencies on JUCE 5.4.x! We love JUCE for our VST projects.
- Yes, we know, we haven't done a lot of optimization; it is reasonably fast, though. We're still in R&D so flexibility is a plus.

# WHAT IS FM. BISON?

Combining proven entrepreneurial skills and over 2 decades of programming experience
we dipped our toes in synthesis and offer this first draft of our technology.

Our goal is to create efficient & high-fidelity synthesizer software.

What inspired FM. BISON is the 1980s digital revolution chiefly based on frequency modulation (or 'FM'),
as discovered by accident by John Chowning in 1967. This type of synthesis yields a very distinct
sound that helped artists like Prince, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Brian Eno and many others
to define their new sound, often using the Yamaha DX7.

We stand on the shoulders of thousands of creative innovators, engineers, artists *and* the public
domain and we invite you to profit from the work we are doing to take FM to another level.

Our code is open to study, disassemble, improve and use in any way you like, so long as you adhere
to the MIT license.

Please refer to the Github issue list to keep track of our to-do list, to see what we're aware of and working 
on and the new features or improvements we have in mind.

This code is currently in use/development for our in-development Monk MKI plug-in (a 1980s-inspired virtual keyboard instrument). We'll announce when it's ready to hit the market.

Any significant contributions to this codebase will of course grant you a free copy!

And if you use or benefit from our open development, we would love a shoutout on your socials, using #FM-BISON!
